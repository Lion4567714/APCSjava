 * Find the edit (Levenshtein) distance between words. Read words from a sorted dictionary file.
 * Compute a map from every word to its immediate neighbors (the words that have an edit distance of
 * 1 from it). You can walk the map to find paths from one word to another, and can use a linked
 * list of words to visit neighbors.

//  Project:    GS11-03 writeSequence
//  Purpose:    Write a recursive method that accepts an integer n as a parameter and prints to the
//              console a symmetric sequence of n numbers composed of descending integers that end
//              in 1, followed by a sequence of ascending integers that begin with 1. When n is odd
//              the sequence has a single 1 in the middle, and when it is even there should be two.
//              Throw an IllegalArgumentException if it has passed a value less than 1.
